Publishing on github
https://pages.github.com/

- create public repo, say naumann.github.com --- actually, repo name is dnaumann.github.io 
- index.html (and whatever supporting files, which I'll keep few for now)

git clone git@github.com:dnaumann/dnaumann.github.io

That's it.

* Research

My focus is on formal methods and software security, including:
relational and hyperproperty verification;
fine-grained confidentiality/integrity policies;
program analysis, verification, and transformation;
correctness by construction; 
program logics and machine-checked metatheory;
and methodology for formal specification of distributed system components.

I'm in the [[https://mgree.github.io/cypress/][Cypress]] group.

* Teaching 

** Courses

Fall 2024: CS 643 Formal Verification of Software 

** Assistantships

Undergraduate summer research:
Contact me early in Spring semester for projects.

PhD positions: 
From time to time I take on new PhD students
for research on software verification and secure information flow: policies, static analysis, and runtime monitoring.  Full funding is provided.   The ideal candidates have background in programming language theory and implementation or formal methods.
